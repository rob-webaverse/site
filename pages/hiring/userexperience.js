          <p>
            Do you wish "the game would just work this way"?
            Do you hunt for glitches?
            Do you love to file GitHub issues?
            Do you love to explore new features?
            Do you switch devices and Incognito a lot?
            Are you great at explaining how to reproduce crazy corner cases?
            Do you often open up the console to see what the heck is going on?
            We need you to lead the Webaverse user experience.
